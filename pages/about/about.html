<h1>About myself</h1>
<p><em>My name is Chinemerem Umeozulu born and grew up in Lagos state, Nigeria. I'm 15 years of age and from Amesi,
    Anambra. I attend Rainbow College Day and at this moment in time, in the final year of senior secondary school education.
    In the near future wish to be  well-skilled in the computer world especially with the way the world is revolving 
    around it. I'm a born Christian and i enjoy reading, watching soccer, engaging myself in football, basketball,
    track races and swimming.</em>
